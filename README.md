# OutfitPainter

This plugin allows you to assign 'Channels' to colors on clothing and accessories, via the new dropdown box under the colors, then bulk change coloring all at once in both Maker and Studio. 

Use the new Outfit Painter menu option on the left menu to access the outfit painter UI. 

In that UI you can:

- Click on the channel names and rename the channel - this changes the text in the drop down menus for your convenience.
- Change the color of everything attached to the channel (including slider values), all at once.

Additionally there is a new Studio UI button on the bottom left menu that brings up a Studio UI. If the currently selected character has an outfit with defined channels you can recolor there as well.
